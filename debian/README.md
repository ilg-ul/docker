These are the Debian 32/64-bits Docker files used to create the Docker images published at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ilegeul/) (and possibly more).

Initially multiple images were considered, but with Debian 9 only one image per platform was created, to be used for the GNU MCU Eclipse builds.
